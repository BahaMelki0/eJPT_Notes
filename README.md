# 🧠 eJPT Notes by K4v0r1_0x

👋 Welcome readers,

I am **K4v0r1_0x** and this is my personal vault of notes for prepping the **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** certification. 🕵️‍♂️💻  
These notes follow the same structure used in the official **INE course** and aim to be concise, practical, and easy to revise.

Hope they make some sense and help you crush the exam. 💪

Enjoy and == **H4ppЧ H4ck1ng** == ☠️👨‍💻

> ⚠️ **NB 1.0**: eJPT is a hands-on exam — reviewing notes alone won’t be enough, especially if you’re new to pentesting. PRACTICE is 🔑.  
> 🚫 **NB 2.0**: Never hack any system without **explicit written permission**.  
> 🔒 **NB 3.0**: These notes are **strictly private** — do not republish them. Some content mirrors the INE course material and must not be shared publicly.
