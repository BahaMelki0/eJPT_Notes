### Introduction to Social Engineering

Social engineering in penetration testing refers to manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. It targets human vulnerabilities—often the weakest link in an organization’s security posture. Despite robust technological defenses, attackers can compromise systems due to poor practices, lack of awareness, or emotional manipulation.

Social engineering techniques rely on exploiting trust, fear, curiosity, and helpfulness. Common goals include tricking employees into revealing passwords, clicking malicious links, or granting unauthorized access. This form of testing helps identify areas where better training and human-centric defenses are needed.

### Social Media and Target Development

Social media platforms are treasure troves for reconnaissance. Information such as job titles, colleague names, vacation plans, and more can be leveraged for highly believable pretexts. Social engineering is not only an offensive technique but also a critical part of threat modeling and employee training.
