Welcome readers, I am K4v0r1_0x and in here you can find all of my notes for the eJPT certification prep. I'll be using the same structure for these notes as the one used in the official course by INE.

Hope this makes some sense for you and helps you nail the exam.

Enjoy and ==H4ppЧ H4ck1ng==.

NB 1.0: Since eJPT is a practical exam, just reviewing these notes won't be sufficient (especially if you're a beginner), so you'll probably need to practice a lot (I'll provide some resources later on).

NB 2.0: Don't try to hack systems without written permission from their owners!!

NB 3.0: These notes are strictly private and cannot/should not be published by any user (because technically they include course material from the official course which shouldn't be shared publicly).

The structure of these notes is as follows:

1 - Assessment Methodologies:

- [[Information Gathering]]
    
- [[Footprinting & Scanning]]
    
- [[Enumeration]]
    
- [[Vulnerability Assessment]]
    

2 - Host & Networking Auditing:

- [[Auditing Fundamentals]]
    

3 - Host & Network Penetration Testing:

- [[System-Host based Attacks]]
    
- [[Network Based Attacks]]
    
- [[The Metasploit Framework]]
    
- [[Exploitation]]
    
- [[Post-Exploitation]]
    
- Social Engineering
    

4 - Web Application Penetration Testing:

- [[Introduction to the Web&HTTP Protocol]]
